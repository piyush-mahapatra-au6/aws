# AWS IAM

- Identity and Access Management
- Used to create User,assign permission

#### When accessing AWS, the root account should never be used. Users must be created with the proper permissions. IAM is central to AWS.

- Users: A physical person
- Groups: Functions (admin, devops) Teams (engineering, design) which contain a group of users
- Roles: Internal usage within AWS resources
- Policies (JSON documents): Defines what each of the above can and cannot do. Note: IAM has predefined managed policies.

### Best practices:

- One IAM User per person ONLY
- One IAM Role per Application
- IAM credentials should NEVER be shared
- Never write IAM credentials in your code. EVER
- Never use the ROOT account except for initial setup
- It's best to give users the minimal amount of permissions to perform their job
